# UMass Events Bot

## Usage

The program requires a bot token to connect to Discord. It does this using a "token" file that is not checked in to git, so that the bot cannot be messed with.

## Commands

* !menu [food name] -- tells you where that food is being served today
* !register [food name] -- schedules it to tell you each day where that food is being served that day
* !events -- tells you the events for that day [[Currently broken!]]
* !quit -- makes the bot quit

## TODO

* Add !help
* Add !deregister
* Fix !events
